Activation of VMware Cloud services requires 2 things:
1. At least one person with a valid [My VMware]({{ site.data.links.vmw.my }}) account. The profile for this account **must** have all required fields populated. See [this](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2086266) kb for instructions on updating the profile.
2. A source of funding for the services (either credit card or through a [My VMware]({{ site.data.links.vmw.my }}) account.

For [VMware Cloud on AWS]({{ site.data.links.vmw.vmcaws }}), activation may either be performed in a [self-serve]({{ site.data.links.vmw.vmcaws_get_started }}) manner or through an Account Manager. The activation will be associated to a My VMware profile and the owner of this profile will be considered to be the **"Fund Owner"** for VMware Cloud services. Once you have been approved for services an activation email will be sent to the email address configured under the  Fund Owner's My VMware profile. Clicking this link will activate your VMware Cloud account.
