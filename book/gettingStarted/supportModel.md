Support in VMware Cloud is broken up into two functions:
1. Front-end support
2. Back-end support

Front-end support is delivered in the form of the CS technical team and is directly available via live-chat or through a formal session scheduled by a CSM. For critical support issues, live-chat is the fastest means of accessing the font-end support teams. In the event that live-chat is unavailable, then front-end support is available by telephone.

Back-end support is delivered in the form of one or more VMware Site Reliablility Engineering (SRE) teams. The SRE teams are responsible for managing and maintaining all cloud services, and perform monitoring of all critical infrastructure under their control. The SRE teams are also responsible for performing updates/upgrades to certain components of the various cloud services. For example, for VMware Cloud on AWS this team is responsible for upgrading the infrastructure components of every production Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) which has been deployed within VMware Cloud.

Since VMware Cloud is an As-A-Service offering, the support model is designed to be 24x7x365. The target response times, however, depend on the severity of the issue. The following table outlines these target response times:

Severity     | Target Response Time
-------------|---------------------
1            | 30 minutes or less
2            | 4 business hours
3            | 8 business hours
4            | 12 business hours
