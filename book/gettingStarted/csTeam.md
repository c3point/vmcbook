The purpose of the VMware Customer Success (CS) team is to act as a customer advocate, and is a resource which is available throughout the entire lifetime of the customer's relationship with VMware. The VMware Cloud CS team is divided into two functions:
1. Customer Success management team
2. Customer Success technical team

These functions are described below.

##### Customer Success Management Team
Fielded by a Customer Success Manager (CSM), this team proactively manages the customer experience with VMware Cloud. Generally, each customer will be assigned a dedicated CSM who will be responsible for the following:
* Develops strong business relationships with key customer stakeholders.
* Develops and maintains success plans for the customer and tracks customer satisfaction with VMware Cloud.
* Facilitate customer interaction with the CS technical team and VMware Product Management and engineering teams.


##### Customer Success Technical Team
The technical team is broken up into two roles:
1. Cloud Services Engineering (CSE)
2. Cloud Services Architects (CSA)

The CSE acts as the primary point of contact for technical issues with VMware Cloud service deployments. For critical issues, CSEs are available immediately via chat support. For non-critical issues, the CSM may schedule a session with a CSE on the behalf of the customer.

The function of the CSA is to help refine customer business cases, provide design consulting and architectural review services, and to provide technical workshops to customers. The CSA is intended to act as a technical resource for anything beyond technical support issues. Like the CSE, a CSM may schedule sessions with a CSA on behalf of the customer.

Once key attribute of the technical team is that they provide technical **guidance** to customers and do not have the ability to provide hands-on-keyboard type activities. The CS Technical team is meant to act as a resource for customers who want to "do it themselves, but with guidance". For hands-on-keyboard services, the VMware Professional Services team is a more suitable resource and offer design/deploy services which are geared toward customers who need a scoped engagement with defined deliverables.
