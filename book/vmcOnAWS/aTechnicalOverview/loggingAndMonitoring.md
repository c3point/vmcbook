Logging within VMware Cloud is provided via the [Log Intelligence]({{ site.data.links.vmw.lint }}) service.
 This service is activated at the Org level within VMware Cloud, and is offered in free as well as paid tiers.

The following table highlights the key features of the free tier.

Feature                   | Notes
--------------------------|----------
Audit Log Collection      | Unlimited
Non-Audit Log Collection  | 1 GB/Day
Log Retention             | 7 Days
Visualization (Dashboard) |
Search and Save Query     |

The free tier offers users a means of searching visualizing audit logs (i.e. logs from the SDDC infrastructure) as well as a small amount of non-audit logs.
 When the service is initially activated, users will gain access to a 30-day free trial for the paid tier of the service.
 This paid tier offers features such as longer log retention, unlimited non-audit logging, long-term archival, alerting, log forwarding, and more.
 At the end of the 30-day trial, the service will drop down to the free tier unless users opt to continue with the paid tier.
